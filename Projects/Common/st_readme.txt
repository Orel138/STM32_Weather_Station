### 12-April-2024 ###
=========================

Changes:

--- Features ---

* Add clear command for clearing the screen

--- Porting ---

* Port for EWARM IDE

* Port for STM32H7S series

* Add KVStore External Flash backend for STM32H7S series.


### 31-August-2023 ###
=========================

Changes:

--- Features ---

* Enable Ethernet as an alternative to EMW3080 Wi-Fi.

* Introduce the MBEDTLS_TRANSPORT_PSA_HAS_PS compilation switch, so that the dependency on PSA Protected Storage API
  may be removed, since the STM32H5 Secure Manager does not implement it.

* Add auto-provisioning code for importing the Device User Authentication - User certificate in secure storage.

* Support blank chars in the Wi-Fi SSID.

* Add telemetry for network data. To be used especially on boards which do not embed e.g. environmental or acceleration
  sensors.

* Add an internal event to track the TLS connection status.

* Logging improvement
  - Add image version details in the OTA logs
  - Do not tuncate long tick values
  - Utility to display a PSA function name from its Secure Manager IDs

--- Platform porting ---

* Move IP init to the platform init section generated by the STM32CubeMX tool
  - Interrupt handlers
  - UART
  - Profiling timer

--- Fixes ---

* Improve resilience to
  - null subAck context in prvResubscribeCommandCallback().
  - errors in NVM access

* Fix compilation warnings
  - const function arguments
  - array bound writes in the KVStore littlefs backend

--- Optimization ---  

* Tune stack sizes
  - Minimal
  - OTA Agent
  - Timer
  - LwIP
  - MX driver dataplane and controlplane

* Compatibility with MbedTLS optimizations
  - Remove RSA support
  - Remove the error strings
